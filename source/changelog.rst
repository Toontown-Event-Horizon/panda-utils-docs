Changelog
=========

Breaking changes are displayed with the ðŸ’¥ collision symbol. Only changes that are likely to break the workflow
of a user are considered breaking. The changes that affect the internal structure of the built/ folder and such
(when using Asset Pipeline) are *not* considered breaking. Bugfixes are also not considered breaking
unless I believe the bug had a legitimate usecase.

Versions were not saved before 1.0, so those are not in the changelog.
